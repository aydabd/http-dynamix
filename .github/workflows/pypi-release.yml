# PyPI package release workflow template
#
# Before using this workflow, ensure:
# 1. Your project uses hatch for building (or replace 'hatch build' with your build tool).
# 2. You have enabled OIDC authentication for your PyPI project (see https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/ for setup).
#    - Go to your PyPI project settings > 'Add a trusted publisher' and follow the instructions for GitHub Actions.
#    - Set the environment name below to match your PyPI trusted publisher configuration (default: Production).
# 3. If you use a password/token instead, add 'password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}' under 'with:' in the publish step.
# 4. This workflow triggers on pushes to 'main' and on version tags (e.g., 1.2.3).
# 5. You can reuse this template in other repositories with minimal changes.
